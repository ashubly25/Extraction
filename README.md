# Extraction

# who is it created for?
   Professional photographers (especially for wedding photographers) who deals with 1000s of images.
 
# How this tool works?
### A sample scenario
   Consider you have 1000s of RAW Photos from photoshoot. And you want to shortlist some picture. E.g. lets estimate you like some 200 photos out of 2500 pics for editing/showcasing.
   
   The problem is, it is hard to transfer 2500 RAW photos of size more than 20Gigs to the edit, and mostly impossible for the any ordinary user to view the RAW images from their mobile/desktop.
   
   So, photographers generally compress and convert the RAW photos (Via Lightroom or Darktable) to simple JPEGs of each size 100-200Kb and send the photos via cloud for them to shortlist. 
   
#### The script put into action
    
   * Folder -A) Now you have a Original RAW pics folder called "Main Source" that contain 1000s of RAW images in Full Quality.
    
   * Folder -B) And the client has shortlisted 100 photos from the low-quality JPEGs that you sent them. Now you have all those low-quality JPEGs saved in folder called "Selected Photos"
    
   * Folder -C) You want to particularly extract those 100 short listed photos from the oringal Folder-A to a separate folder and edit/retouch the photos before you print them. 
    
 
 Open this script, Just paste the folder path of A), B) and C) this script will automatically compare and copy the selected High Res RAW images to the folder
